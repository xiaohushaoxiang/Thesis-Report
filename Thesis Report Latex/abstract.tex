Pedestrian indoor localization is a problem yet to have a solution that is as generally accepted as the Global Positioning System is for outdoor localization. An infrastructure-independent option is to leverage the data from \ac{IMU} sensors to determine position. A large advantage of this approach is that these sensors are already available to many people as they are often integrated into the modern smartphone. Creating an indoor localization solution that works on this device could lead to widespread adoption. This has been recognized by the research community, with methods already being tested on the device. An interesting combination worth considering is the combination of smartphone-based indoor localization with the emerging market of wearable technology. This new technology has the potential to provide additional information that could improve indoor localization. One option is to detect activity that is not easily detectable from smartphones alone, such as those performed with hands.

Within this thesis, a proof of concept is designed with the goal of finding a way in which activity recognition from wearable tech can help smartphone-based indoor localization.
The implementation within this thesis relies only on the \ac{IMU} data of a smartwatch and smartphone, and map information of the indoor environment.  \par 

The system consists of two subsystems placed in series, where the output of the first subsystem, the \ac{SHS}, is the input of the second subsystem, the Particle Filter with spatial context. The \ac{SHS} uses \ac{IMU} data from the smartphone to determine if a step is taken, what its length is, and in what direction it was taken. 
The Particle Filter with spatial context uses the resulting \ac{SHS} trajectory to generate a position estimate in an indoor environment. It uses spatial constraints, such as walls, to limit the estimate. The \ac{IMU} data of a smartwatch is used to detect door interactions. These interactions in combination with known door locations calibrate the position estimates to door locations. \par 

In order to evaluate performance, experiments were performed in an indoor environment where map information was available, with six trials being walked. Smartphone and smartwatch {IMU} data were recorded. Door interactions were also recorded manually.
Results from the experiments show that, although false positives in detection can have a detrimental effect on the position estimate, activity recognition can improve position estimates for a smartphone-based system using the design presented in this thesis.
