abstract = {Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has focused on noisy but unique data associations resulting in linear Gaussian uncertainty models. However, a unique decision is often not possible using only local information, giving rise to ambiguities that have to be resolved globally during optimization. To solve this problem, the pose graph data structure is extended here by multimodal constraints modeled by mixtures of Gaussians (MoG). Furthermore, optimization methods for this novel formulation are introduced, namely (a) robust iteratively reweighted least squares, and (b) Prefilter Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) where a preprocessing step determines globally consistent modes before applying SGD. In addition, a variant of the Prefilter method (b) is introduced in form of (c) Prefilter Levenberg-Marquardt. The methods are compared with traditional state-of-the-art optimization methods including (d) Stochastic Gradient Descent and (e) Levenberg-Marquardt as well as (f) Particle filter SLAM and with (g) an optimal exhaustive algorithm. Experiments show that ambiguities significantly impact state-of-the-art methods, and that the novel Prefilter methods (b) and (c) perform best. This is further substantiated with experiments using real-world data. To this end, a method to generate MoG constraints from a plane-based registration algorithm is introduced and used for 3D SLAM under ambiguities. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2013.},

abstract = {Pedestrian navigation using inertial sensors constitutes an infrastructure-free positioning system. The fact that inertial sensors are already available in every smartphone or other carry on devices constitutes their great advantage and makes them especially interesting for mass market applications. This chapter offers a detailed explanation of the estimation of the orientation of the sensor, since it is of key importance in order to compute the position of the user. The positioning is usually derived in two different ways depending on the location of the sensor on the human body. These two approaches are deeply explained in this chapter. Disregarding the location on the human body where the sensor is mounted on, the accumulated drift error on the estimated positioning is still an unsolved issue using medium- and low-cost inertial sensors. The latest algorithms proposed to tackle the drift error are summarized in this chapter. Finally, an overview of the upcoming pedestrian inertial positioning is offered.},

abstract = {Physical activity recognition using embedded sensors has enabled many context-aware applications in different areas, such as healthcare. Initially, one or more dedicated wearable sensors were used for such applications. However, recently, many researchers started using mobile phones for this purpose, since these ubiquitous devices are equipped with various sensors, ranging from accelerometers to magnetic field sensors. In most of the current studies, sensor data collected for activity recognition are analyzed offline using machine learning tools. However, there is now a trend towards implementing activity recognition systems on these devices in an online manner, since modern mobile phones have become more powerful in terms of available resources, such as CPU, memory and battery. The research on offline activity recognition has been reviewed in several earlier studies in detail. However, work done on online activity recognition is still in its infancy and is yet to be reviewed. In this paper, we review the studies done so far that implement activity recognition systems on mobile phones and use only their on-board sensors. We discuss various aspects of these studies. Moreover, we discuss their limitations and present various recommendations for future research.},

@article{Qian2013,
abstract = {In this paper, an improved indoor localization method based on smartphone inertial sensors is presented. Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR), which determines the relative location change of a pedestrian without additional infrastructure supports, is combined with a floor plan for a pedestrian positioning in our work. To address the challenges of low sampling frequency and limited processing power in smartphones, reliable and efficient PDR algorithms have been proposed. A robust step detection technique leaves out the preprocessing of raw signal and reduces complex computation. Given the fact that the precision of the stride length estimation is influenced by different pedestrians and motion modes, an adaptive stride length estimation algorithm based on the motion mode classification is developed. Heading estimation is carried out by applying the principal component analysis (PCA) to acceleration measurements projected to the global horizontal plane, which is independent of the orientation of a smartphone. In addition, to eliminate the sensor drift due to the inaccurate distance and direction estimations, a particle filter is introduced to correct the drift and guarantee the localization accuracy. Extensive field tests have been conducted in a laboratory building to verify the performance of proposed algorithm. A pedestrian held a smartphone with arbitrary orientation in the tests. Test results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve significant performance improvements in terms of efficiency, accuracy and reliability. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

abstract = {Recently, there have been a wide range of mobile computing and crowd-sourcing applications that leverage the proliferating sensing capabilities of smartphones. Many of these place a paramount importance on accurate user heading estimation. Such applications include dead-reckoning-based localization and many crowd-sensing applications where the user typically carry her phone in arbitrary positions and orientations relative to her body and her transportation mode. However, there is no general solution available to estimate the user's heading as current state-of-the-art focus on improving the phone orientation estimation, require the phone to be placed in a particular position, require a fixed transportation mode, require user intervention, and/or do not work accurately indoors. In this paper we present Humaine, a novel ubiquitous system that reliably and accurately estimates the user orientation relative to the Earth coordinate system. Humaine works accurately whether the user is riding a vehicle or walking indoors/outdoors for arbitrary cell phone positions and orientations relative to the user body. Moreover, it requires no prior-configuration nor user intervention. The system intelligently fuses the different inertial sensors widely available in off-the-shelf smartphones and employs statistical analysis techniques to their measurements to estimate the user orientation. Implementation of the system on different Android devices with 300 experiments performed at different indoor and outdoor testbeds shows that Humaine significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art in diverse scenarios, achieving a median accuracy of 14∘ and 16∘ for indoor and outdoor pedestrian users and 20∘ for in-vehicle users over a wide variety of phone positions. This is better than the-state-of-the-art by 523{\%} and 594{\%} for indoor and outdoor pedestrian users and 750{\%} for in-vehicle users. This accuracy highlights the ubiquity of Humaine and its robustness against the various noise sources.},

@book{Rai2012,
abstract = {Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting, based on WiFi or cellular signals , has been a popular approach to indoor localization. However, its adoption in the real world has been stymied by the need for site-specific calibration, i.e., the creation of a training data set comprising WiFi measurements at known locations in the space of interest. While efforts have been made to reduce this calibration effort using modeling, the need for measurements from known locations still remains a bottleneck. In this paper, we present Zee-a system that makes the calibration zero-effort, by enabling training data to be crowdsourced without any explicit effort on the part of users. Zee leverages the inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, compass, gyroscope) present in the mobile devices such as smartphones carried by users, to track them as they traverse an indoor environment, while simultaneously performing WiFi scans. Zee is designed to run in the background on a device without requiring any explicit user participation. The only site-specific input that Zee depends on is a map showing the pathways (e.g., hallways) and barriers (e.g., walls). A significant challenge that Zee surmounts is to track users without any a priori, user-specific knowledge such as the user's initial location, stride-length, or phone placement. Zee employs a suite of novel techniques to infer location over time: (a) placement-independent step counting and orientation estimation, (b) augmented particle filtering to simultaneously estimate location and user-specific walk characteristics such as the stride length, (c) back propagation to go back and improve the accuracy of lo-calization in the past, and (d) WiFi-based particle initialization to enable faster convergence. We present an evaluation of Zee in a large office building.},

With activity recognition having considerably matured, so has the number of challenges in designing, implementing, and evaluating activity recognition systems. This tutorial aims to provide a comprehensive hands-on introduction for newcomers to the field of human activity recognition. It specifically focuses on activity recognition using on-body inertial sensors. We first discuss the key research challenges that human activity recognition shares with general pattern recognition and identify those challenges that are specific to human activity recognition. We then describe the concept of an Activity Recognition Chain (ARC) as a general-purpose framework for designing and evaluating activity recognition systems. We detail each component of the framework, provide references to related research, and introduce the best practice methods developed by the activity recognition research community. We conclude with the educational example problem of recognizing different hand gestures from inertial sensors attached to the upper and lower arm. We illustrate how each component of this framework can be implemented for this specific activity recognition problem and demonstrate how different implementations compare and how they impact overall recognition performance. {\textcopyright} 2014 ACM.},

Compared with other decision tree induction techniques that are based upon recursive partitioning employing greedy searches to choose the best splitting attribute and value at each node that will necessarily miss regions of the search space, the genetic programming based approach can overcome the problem. However, the method still requires the discretization of the often continuous-valued toxicity endpoints prior to the tree induction. A novel extension of this method, YAdapt, is introduced in this work which models the original continuous endpoint by adaptively finding suitable ranges to describe the endpoints during the tree induction process, removing the need for discretization prior to tree induction and allowing the ordinal nature of the endpoint to be taken into account in the models built.},

Similarly, smartphones are already being used for activity recognition. In this paper, we study the fusion of a wrist-worn device (smartwatch) and a smartphone for human activity recognition. We evaluate these two devices for their strengths and weaknesses in recognizing various daily physical activities. We use three classifiers to recognize 13 different activities, such as smoking, eating, typing, writing, drinking coffee, giving a talk, walking, jogging, biking, walking upstairs, walking downstairs, sitting, and standing. Some complex activities, such as smoking, eating, drinking coffee, giving a talk, writing, and typing cannot be recognized with a smartphone in the pocket position alone. We show that the combination of a smartwatch and a smartphone recognizes such activities with a reasonable accuracy. The recognition of such complex activities can enable well-being applications for detecting bad habits, such as smoking, missing a meal, and drinking too much coffee. We also show how to fuse information from these devices in an energy-efficient way by using low sampling rates. We make our dataset publicly available in order to make our work reproducible.},

abstract = {In this paper we present the uDirect algorithm as a novel approach for mobile phone centric observation of a user's facing direction, through which the device and user orientations relative to earth coordinate are estimated. While the device orientation estimation is based on accelerometer and magnetometer measurements in standing mode, the unique behavior of measured acceleration during stance phase of a human's walking cycle is used for detecting user direction. Furthermore, the algorithm is independent of initial orientation of the device which gives the user higher space of freedom for long term observations. As the algorithm only relies on embedded accelerometer and magnetometer sensors of the mobile phone, it is not susceptible to shadowing effect as GPS. In addition, by performing independent estimations during each step of walking the model is robust to error accumulation. Evaluating the algorithm with 180 data samples from 10 participates has empirically confirmed the assumptions of our analytical model about the unique characteristics of the human stance phase for direction estimation. Moreover, our initial inspection has shown a system based on our algorithm outperforms conventional use of GPS and PCA analysis based techniques for walking distances more than 2 steps. {\textcopyright} 2011 IEEE.},

abstract = {This paper presents a pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) approach based on motion mode recognition using a smartphone. The motion mode consists of pedestrian movement state and phone pose. With the support vector machine (SVM) and the decision tree (DT), the arbitrary combinations of movement state and phone pose can be recognized successfully. In the traditional principal component analysis based (PCA-based) method, the obtained horizontal accelerations in one stride time interval cannot be guaranteed to be horizontal and the pedestrian's direction vector will be influenced. To solve this problem, we propose a PCA-based method with global accelerations (PCA-GA) to infer pedestrian's headings. Besides, based on the further analysis of phone poses, an ambiguity elimination method is also developed to calibrate the obtained headings. The results indicate that the recognition accuracy of the combinations of movement states and phone poses can be 92.4{\%}. The 50{\%} and 75{\%} absolute estimation errors of pedestrian's headings are 5.6° and 9.2°, respectively. This novel PCA-GA based method can achieve higher accuracy than traditional PCA-based method and heading offset method. The localization error can reduce to around 3.5 m in a trajectory of 164 m for different movement states and phone poses.},

The orientation, particularly the heading estimation, is one of the most critical parts of the navigation system. The heading angle suffers from drift error. The algorithms proposed in the literature apply position corrections, which do not prevent the drift error to grow. We propose a novel landmark-based drift compensation algorithm, which allows the navigation system to generate drift compensated trajectories without the need of a post-processing stage. The chosen landmarks are corners and stairs, which are plentiful in indoor environments. Landmarks are seamlessly detected while the user walks. We test our algorithm with quasi-error-free turn rate measurements with known errors and also with mediumcost sensors. We provide in this work the proof of concept that the proposed algorithm is able to compute the underlying drift error and feed it back to the orientation estimator to generate drift compensated trajectories. Our algorithm is able to adapt to slow drift changes during the walk, thus suited for long duration walks.},

abstract = {Indoor localization at minimal deployment effort and with low costs is relevant for many ambient intelligence and mobile computing applications. This paper presents ActionSLAM, a novel approach to Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) for pedestrian indoor tracking that makes use of body-mounted sensors. ActionSLAM iteratively builds a map of the environment and localizes the user within this map. A foot-mounted Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) keeps track of the user's path, while observations of location-related actions (e.g. door-opening or sitting on a chair) are used to compensate for drift error accumulation in a particle filter framework. Location-related actions are recognizable from body-mounted IMUs that are often used in ambient-assisted living scenarios for context awareness. Thus localization relies only on on-body sensing and requires no ambient infrastructure such as Wi-Fi access points or radio beacons. We characterize ActionSLAM on a dataset of 1.69km walking in three rooms and involving 241 location-related actions. For the experimental dataset, the algorithm robustly tracked the subject with mean error of 1.2m. The simultaneously built map reflects the building layout and positions landmarks with a mean error of 0.5m. These results were achieved with a simulated action recognition system consisting of an IMU attached to the wrist of a user and a smartphone in his pocket. We found that employing more complex action recognition is not beneficial for ActionSLAM performance. Our findings are supported by evaluations in synthetic environments through simulation of IMU signals for walks in typical home scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

abstract = {Inertial sensors are included in most of the current smart devices and many researchers have identified their ability to be used for analyzing different parameters of human behavior. Among them, the pedestrian's step length provides very useful information for different applications, such as pedestrian dead reckoning positioning or gait analysis. During the last three decades, many step length estimation methods using inertial sensors have been proposed; however, there is no specific review work that reflects the current state of the art. In this paper, we will conduct a systematic and complete review that covers the whole workflow of tasks involved in the design, test, and evaluation of step length estimation methods based on inertial sensors. The main conclusion drawn from this review is that the lack of public data sets and standard methodologies to guide testing and evaluation makes it difficult to compare the different methods in a fair and robust way. Some reflections on how to move forward on this direction have been presented.},

abstract = {Positioning applications became more important in recent years not only for security applications, but also for the mass market. Having a pedestrian navigation system embedded in a mobile phone is a realistic solution since it is equipped with low-cost sensors and the smartphone is located in a non-obstructive way. The location of the smartphone is important, since the position estimation process depends on it. Therefore, we propose to distinguish between pocket or bag, phoning, texting and swinging. We present a standalone inertial pocket navigation system based on an inertial measurement unit. For the computation of the orientation, we have developed an attitude estimator based on an unscented Kalman filter. The update stage has two different updates based on the acceleration and the magnetic field. Therefore, a zero acceleration detector, a magnetic disturbances detector and a static periods detector have been developed. The odometry in our navigation system is computed through an extended Kalman filter. The position is predicted with a movement model which is periodically updated through position corrections computed by the position computer. It comprises a step detector and a step length estimator based on the norm of the acceleration. The performance of our attitude estimator in comparison with the ground truth orientation is shown. The rest of the handheld positions are also tested for orientation. Likewise, we show pocket odometries of different users with the floor plan superimposed. {\textcopyright} 2014 IEEE.},

Inertial sensor measurements are obtained at high sampling rates and can be integrated to obtain position and orientation information. These estimates are accurate on a short time scale, but suffer from integration drift over longer time scales. To overcome this issue, inertial sensors are typically combined with additional sensors and models. In this tutorial we focus on the signal processing aspects of position and orientation estimation using inertial sensors. We discuss different modeling choices and a selected number of important algorithms. The algorithms include optimization-based smoothing and filtering as well as computationally cheaper extended Kalman filter and complementary filter implementations.

These use inertial and other sensors, often combined with domain-specific knowledge about walking, to track user movements. There is currently a wealth of relevant literature spread across different research communities. In this survey, a taxonomy of modern PDRs is developed and used to contextualise the contributions from different areas. Techniques for step detection, characterisation, inertial navigation and step-and-heading-based dead-reckoning are reviewed and compared. Techniques that incorporate building maps through particle filters are analysed, along with hybrid systems that use absolute position fixes to correct dead-reckoning output. In addition, consideration is given to the possibility of using smartphones as PDR sensing devices. The survey concludes that PDR techniques alone can offer good short-to medium-term tracking under certain circumstances, but that regular absolute position fixes from partner systems will be needed to ensure long-term operation and to cope with unexpected behaviours. It concludes by identifying a detailed list of challenges for PDR researchers. {\textcopyright} 2013 IEEE.},

The way of carrying the device in all modes is unconstrained to offer reliable person-independent tracking. Based on the identification of modes, a lightweight step-based tracking algorithm is developed with a novel step length estimation model. The tracking system is implemented on a commercial off-the-shelf smartphone equipped with a built-in inertial measurement unit with 3-D accelerometer and gyroscope. It achieves real-time tracking and localization performance with an average position accuracy of 98.91{\%}.},

In our approach we interpret the movements as motion constraints and door handling events as landmark detections in a graph-based SLAM framework. As we cannot distinguish between individual doors, we employ a multi-hypothesis approach on top of the SLAM system to deal with the high data-association uncertainty. As a result, our approach is able to accurately and robustly recover the trajectory of the person. We additionally take advantage of the fact that people traverse free space and that doors separate rooms to recover the geometric structure of the environment after the graph optimization.

We discussed the pros and cons of using these models for large and small data sets. The classification results show that Random Forest gives better results for the same number of attributes and large data sets i.e. with greater number of instances, while J48 is handy with small data sets (less number of instances).

To this purpose, acceleration patterns of the trunk and their relationships with spatio-temporal gait parameters were analysed in healthy subjects. Based on model predictions of the body's centre of mass trajectory during walking, algorithms were developed to determine spatio-temporal gait parameters from trunk acceleration data. In a first experiment, predicted gait parameters were compared with gait parameters determined from ground reaction forces measured by a treadmill. In a second experiment, spatio-temporal gait parameters were determined during overground walking. From the results of these experiments, it is concluded that, in healthy subjects, the duration of subsequent stride cycles and left/right steps, and estimations of step length and walking speed can be obtained from lower trunk accelerations. The possibility to identify subsequent stride cycles can be the basis for an analysis of other signals (e.g. kinematic or muscle activity) within the stride cycle. {\textcopyright} 2002 Elsevier Science B.V.

abstract = {Because human activities impact the timing, location, and degree of pollutant exposure, they play a key role in explaining exposure variation. This fact has motivated the collection of activity pattern data for their specific use in exposure assessments. The largest of these recent efforts is the National Human Activity Pattern Survey (NHAPS), a 2-year probability-based telephone survey (n=9386) of exposure-related human activities in the United States (U.S.) sponsored by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The primary purpose of NHAPS was to provide comprehensive and current exposure information over broad geographical and temporal scales, particularly for use in probabilistic population exposure models. NHAPS was conducted on a virtually daily basis from late September 1992 through September 1994 by the University of Maryland's Survey Research Center using a computer-assisted telephone interview instrument (CATI) to collect 24-h retrospective diaries and answers to a number of personal and exposure-related questions from each respondent. The resulting diary records contain beginning and ending times for each distinct combination of location and activity occurring on the diary day (i.e., each microenvironment). Between 340 and 1713 respondents of all ages were interviewed in each of the 10 EPA regions across the 48 contiguous states. Interviews were completed in 63{\%} of the households contacted. NHAPS respondents reported spending an average of 87{\%} of their time in enclosed buildings and about 6{\%} of their time in enclosed vehicles. These proportions are fairly constant across the various regions of the U.S. and Canada and for the California population between the late 1980s, when the California Air Resources Board (CARB) sponsored a state-wide activity pattern study, and the mid-1990s, when NHAPS was conducted. However, the number of people exposed to environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) in California seems to have decreased over the same time period, where exposure is determined by the reported time spent with a smoker. In both California and the entire nation, the most time spent exposed to ETS was reported to take place in residential locations.},

Algorithms for detecting steps and estimating their length can be found throughout the literature. In this paper we present new algorithms that increase the accuracy of the estimated step length and decrease the number of undetected steps. Unlike state of the art algorithms, that use the acceleration to detect steps and the frequency or the acceleration to estimate the step length, we propose the use of the opening angle of the pedestrian's leg. An experiment with 18 volunteers was conducted in order to prove the relationship between the opening angle of the leg and the step length. Our results show that the estimation of the step length is robust against speed changes and the trajectory's estimated length has less than 1{\%} error. Our step detector outperforms state of the art algorithms by presenting a higher step detection rate in challenging scenarios. In conclusion, it is possible and convenient to make use of the opening angle of the leg and its relationship with the step length.},

A remaining PDR critical issue is the estimation of the walking direction. Existing methods are principally searching for the energy main axis, but they do not consider the variability of hand movements introducing robustness issues. A new method, based on statistical models and likelihood maximization adjusted to the person and his/her activity, is proposed in this paper. Performance is assessed with experiments in a motion capture room and a shopping mall. The new statistical approach gives globally better results than state of the art methods. A 1.4° to 15.3° error on the walking direction estimates is found over several '1-km walk' tests indoors.},

abstract = {Human walking exhibits small variations in both step length and step width, some of which may be related to active balance control. Lateral balance is thought to require integrative sensorimotor control through adjustment of step width rather than length, contributing to greater variability in step width. Here we propose that step length variations are largely explained by the typical human preference for step length to increase with walking speed, which itself normally exhibits some slow and spontaneous fluctuation. In contrast, step width variations should have little relation to speed if they are produced more for lateral balance. As a test, we examined hundreds of overground walking steps by healthy young adults (N = 14, age {\textless} 40 yrs.). We found that slow fluctuations in self-selected walking speed (2.3{\%} coefficient of variation) could explain most of the variance in step length (59{\%}, P {\textless} 0.01). The residual variability not explained by speed was small (1.5{\%} coefficient of variation), suggesting that step length is actually quite precise if not for the slow speed fluctuations. Step width varied over faster time scales and was independent of speed fluctuations, with variance 4.3 times greater than that for step length (P {\textless} 0.01) after accounting for the speed effect. That difference was further magnified by walking with eyes closed, which appears detrimental to control of lateral balance. Humans appear to modulate fore-aft foot placement in precise accordance with slow fluctuations in walking speed, whereas the variability of lateral foot placement appears more closely related to balance. Step variability is separable in both direction and time scale into balance- and speed-related components. The separation of factors not related to balance may reveal which aspects of walking are most critical for the nervous system to control. {\textcopyright} 2013 Collins, Kuo.},

This provides the prospect of a broad application for the inertial sensor-based pedestrian dead-reckoning (IPDR) systems. Especially for indoor navigation and indoor positioning, the IPDR systems have many unique advantages that other methods do not have. At present, a large number of technologies and methods for IPDR systems are proposed. In this paper, we have analyzed and outlined the IPDR systems based on about 80 documents in the field of IPDR in recent years. The article is structured in the form of an introduction-elucidation-conclusion framework. First, we proposed a general framework to explore the structure of an IPDR system. Then, according to this framework, the IPDR system was divided into six relatively independent subproblems, which were discussed and summarized separately. Finally, we proposed a graph structure of IPDR systems, and a sub-directed graph, formed by selecting a combined path from the start node to the end node, skillfully constitutes a technical route of one specific IPDR system. At the end of the article, we summarized some key issues that need to be resolved before the IPDR systems are widely used.},

Therefore research teams are developing different systems, which can be used as a suitable alternative. One of options is to use Inertial Navigation System (INS) which consists of inertial sensors and mathematic procedures. This concept has been known for a long time, but with arrival of Microelectro Mechanical System (MEMS) INS found wide use. Smartphones with inertial sensors, such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, allow us to use them as input devices for Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR). In this paper we present PDR by using smartphone sensors. They can be classified as low-cost Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), and have been compared with more precise and expensive Xsens IMU. Accuracy of inertial sensors has increased in the past few years, but they still cannot alone provide proper accuracy because of many negative effects, such as heading drift due to gyroscope bias. Particle Filter (PF) has been successfully used with map constraints to increase the accuracy of proposed location system. Presented results show that low-cost smartphone IMU combined with PF can be applicable as proper navigation system.},

abstract = {The recent indoor localization techniques use inertial sensors for position estimations in order to obtain a certain degree of freedom from infrastructure based solutions. Unfortunately, this dependency cannot be completely eliminated due to the cumulative errors induced in the localization process. While many methods are designed to reduce the required number of reference points or try to offer unsupervised maintenance, completely infrastructure independent solutions are still missing. In this paper we propose a novel approach for mobile-based indoor localization and navigation services by introducing a context-aware localization framework. We exploit the ability to recognize certain human motion patterns with a smartphone, representing activities related to walking, climbing stairs, taking escalators, etc. This allows the detection of corridors, staircases and escalators, knowledge which can be used to create building interior related reference points. Based on these a scenario specific context interpreter controls the localization process and provides position refinement for the elimination of the cumulated errors. Using our solution the auxiliary reference points can be omitted, thus, a completely infrastructure-free localization system is formed. The proposed solution is evaluated in a subway scenario and its performance is analysed focusing on the influence of dead-reckoning error on path reconstruction, the effect of activity detection quality on localization performance, respectively the benefits of using additional context-related information. The results are promising, our solution presents good localization and path reconstruction performance, showing potential for real-world scenarios, where the deployment of auxiliary localization infrastructure is unfeasible.},

One of the major reasons why speech models based on Markov chains have not been developed until recently was the lack of a method for optimizing the parameters of the Markov model to match observed signal patterns. Such a method was proposed in the late 1960s and was immediately applied to speech processing in several research institutions. Continued refinements in the theory and implementation of Markov modeling techniques have greatly enhanced the method, leading to a wide range of applications of these models. It is the purpose of this tutorial paper to give an introduction to the theory of Markov models and to illustrate how they have been applied to problems in speech recognition.},

Hereby, we have studied the influence of different walking speeds and four typical sensor positions on the models' performance. Results indicate that smartphone position affected the performance of most acceleration-based models derived from a gait model. Their performance deteriorated if smartphone was carried in hand or pocket. Walking speed affected the performance of models that include step frequency when tuned with personalized sets of constants. Most of them performed better for fast and normal walking speeds.

Walking or running speed is calculated with the estimated stride length divided by the measured stride time.

This sensor has triaxial orthogonal accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers. We describe, implement and compare several of the most relevant algorithms for step detection, stride length, heading and position estimation. The challenge using MEMS is to provide location estimations with enough accuracy and a limited drift. Several tests were conducted outdoors and indoors, and we found that the stride length estimation errors were about 1{\%}. The positioning errors were almost always below 5{\%} of the total travelled distance. The main source of positioning errors are the absolute orientation estimation. {\textcopyright}2009 IEEE.},

As the integration of multiple inertial sensors (e.g., accelerometer, gyroscope, and magnetometer) to nowadays smartphones in recent years, human-centric mobility sensing is emerging and coming into vogue. Mobility information, as a new dimension in addition to wireless signals, can benefit localization in a number of ways, since location and mobility are by nature related in physical world. In this article, we survey this new trend of mobility enhancing smartphone-based indoor localization. Specifically, we first study how to measure human mobility: what types of sensors we can use and what types of mobility information we can acquire. Next, we discuss how mobility assists lo-calization with respect to enhancing location accuracy, decreasing deployment cost, and enriching location context. Moreover, considering the quality and cost of smartphone built-in sensors, handling measurement errors is essential and accordingly investigated. Combining existing work and our own working experiences, we emphasize the principles and conduct comparative study of the mainstream technologies. Finally, we conclude this survey by addressing future research directions and opportunities in this new and largely open area.},

To address this problem, we propose APFiLoc—a low cost, smartphone-based framework for indoor localization.

A clustering method based on distance constraints is developed to detect organic landmarks in an unsupervised way, and the least square support vector machine is used to classify seed landmarks. A series of real-world experiments were conducted in complex environments including multiple floors and the results show APFiLoc can achieve 80{\%} accuracy (phone in the hand) and around 70{\%} accuracy (phone in the pocket) of the error less than 2 m error without the assistance of infrastructure like Wi-Fi access points.},

abstract = {Microelectromechanical Systems (MEMS) technology is playing a key role in the design of the new generation of smartphones. Thanks to their reduced size, reduced power consumption, MEMS sensors can be embedded in above mobile devices for increasing their functionalities. However, MEMS cannot allow accurate autonomous location without external updates, e.g., from GPS signals, since their signals are degraded by various errors. When these sensors are fixed on the user's foot, the stance phases of the foot can easily be determined and periodic Zero velocity UPdaTes (ZUPTs) are performed to bound the position error. When the sensor is in the hand, the situation becomes much more complex. First of all, the hand motion can be decoupled from the general motion of the user. Second, the characteristics of the inertial signals can differ depending on the carrying modes. Therefore, algorithms for characterizing the gait cycle of a pedestrian using a handheld device have been developed. A classifier able to detect motion modes typical for mobile phone users has been designed and implemented. According to the detected motion mode, adaptive step detection algorithms are applied. Success of the step detection process is found to be higher than 97{\%} in all motion modes. {\textcopyright} 2013 by the authors; licensee MDPI, Basel, Switzerland.},

@article{Zhang2016,
abstract = {This paper presents a foot-mounted inertial sensor system for pedestrian localization, and aims to find an adaptive stance detection method for pedestrian gait analysis. The approach is based on a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, which divides the gaits into two types: walking and running. For walking, the algorithm uses two threshold conditions and a median filter to detect stance and still phases. For running, a new step detection method based on Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is used to roughly identify every step of running at first, and then empirical formulas are summarized between the average velocity of each step and thresholds. The corrected thresholds based on empirical formulas are used in the second-round accurate stance detection. The localization accuracy for running is largely improved in this algorithm.},

@article{Abdulrahim2011,
abstract = {In environments where GNSS is unavailable or not useful for positioning, the use of low cost MEMS-based inertial sensors has paved a way to a more cost effective solution. Of particular interest is a foot mounted pedestrian navigation system, where zero velocity updates (ZUPT) are used with the standard strapdown navigation algorithm in a Kalman filter to restrict the error growth of the low cost inertial sensors. However heading drift still remains despite using ZUPT measurements since the heading error is unobservable. External sensors such as magnetometers are normally used to mitigate this problem, but the reliability of such an approach is questionable because of the existence of magnetic disturbances that are often very difficult to predict. Hence there is a need to eliminate the heading drift problem for such a low cost system without relying on external sensors to give a possible stand-alone low cost inertial navigation system. In this paper, a novel and effective algorithm for generating heading measurements from basic knowledge of the orientation of the building in which the pedestrian is walking is proposed to overcome this problem. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated through three field trials using only a forward Kalman filter that can work in real-time without any external sensors. This resulted in position accuracy better than 5 m during a 40 minutes walk, about 0.1{\%} in position error of the total distance. Due to its simplistic algorithm, this simple yet very effective solution is appealing for a promising future autonomous low cost inertial navigation system. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Royal Institute of Navigation.},
