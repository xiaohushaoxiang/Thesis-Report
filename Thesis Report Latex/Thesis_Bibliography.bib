abstract = {The position of on-body motion sensors plays an important role in human activity recognition. Most often, mobile phone sensors at the trouser pocket or an equivalent position are used for this purpose. However, this position is not suitable for recognizing activities that involve hand gestures, such as smoking, eating, drinking coffee and giving a talk. To recognize such activities, wrist-worn motion sensors are used. However, these two positions are mainly used in isolation. To use richer context information, we evaluate three motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and linear acceleration sensor) at both wrist and pocket positions. Using three classifiers, we show that the combination of these two positions outperforms the wrist position alone, mainly at smaller segmentation windows. Another problem is that less-repetitive activities, such as smoking, eating, giving a talk and drinking coffee, cannot be recognized easily at smaller segmentation windows unlike repetitive activities, like walking, jogging and biking. For this purpose, we evaluate the effect of seven window sizes (2–30 s) on thirteen activities and show how increasing window size affects these various activities in different ways. We also propose various optimizations to further improve the recognition of these activities. For reproducibility, we make our dataset publicly available.},

In this review paper, we deal with an in-depth analysis and comparison of 13 representative step length estimation models using smartphone inertial sensors: step-frequency-based, acceleration-based, angle-based, and multiparameter. Hereby, we have studied the influence of different walking speeds and four typical sensor positions on the models' performance. Results indicate that smartphone position affected the performance of most acceleration-based models derived from a gait model. Their performance deteriorated if smartphone was carried in hand or pocket. Walking speed affected the performance of models that include step frequency when tuned with personalized sets of constants. Most of them performed better for fast and normal walking speeds. During this research, we also established an open-source dataset that contains over 22 km of gait measurements obtained from a group of 15 healthy adults.},

We explore and optimise further the algorithm and its parameters making use of data collected by three volunteers holding the phone in six different positions. In order to simplify the analysis of the data, we also built a novel device for the detection of the ground truth steps. Over the collected data set, the algorithm reaches 95{\%} average accuracy. We implemented the algorithm for the Android OS and released it as an open source project. A separate dataset was collected with the algorithm running on the smart-phone for further validation. The validation confirms the accuracy of the algorithm in real-time conditions.},

The fact that inertial sensors are already available in every smartphone or other carry on devices constitutes their great advantage and makes them especially interesting for mass market applications. This chapter offers a detailed explanation of the estimation of the orientation of the sensor, since it is of key importance in order to compute the position of the user. The positioning is usually derived in two different ways depending on the location of the sensor on the human body. These two approaches are deeply explained in this chapter. Disregarding the location on the human body where the sensor is mounted on, the accumulated drift error on the estimated positioning is still an unsolved issue using medium- and low-cost inertial sensors. The latest algorithms proposed to tackle the drift error are summarized in this chapter. Finally, an overview of the upcoming pedestrian inertial positioning is offered.},

This paper shows that by careful crafting and accounting for the weak information in the sensor samples, smartphones are capable of pure inertial navigation. We present a probabilistic approach for orientation and use-case free inertial odometry, which is based on double-integrating rotated accelerations. The strength of the model is in learning additive and multiplicative IMU biases online. We are able to track the phone position, velocity, and pose in realtime and in a computationally lightweight fashion by solving the inference with an extended Kalman filter. The information fusion is completed with zero-velocity updates (if the phone remains stationary), altitude correction from barometric pressure readings (if available), and pseudo-updates constraining the momentary speed. We demonstrate our approach using an iPad and iPhone in several indoor dead-reckoning applications and in a measurement tool setup.},

abstract = {The machine recognition of user trajectories and activities is fundamental to devise context-aware applications for support and monitoring in daily life. So far, tracking and activity recognition were mostly considered as orthogonal problems, which limits the richness of possible context inference. In this work, we introduce the novel unified computational and representational framework S-SMART that simultaneously models the environment state (semantic mapping), localizes the user within this map (tracking), and recognizes interactions with the environment (activity recognition). Thus, S-SMART identifies which activities the user executes where (e.g., turning a handle next to a window), and reflects the outcome of these actions by updating the world model (e.g., the window is now open). This in turn conditions the future possibility of executing actions at specific places (e.g., closing the window is likely to be the next action at this location). S-SMART works in a self-contained manner and iteratively builds the semantic map from wearable sensors only. This enables the seamless deployment to new environments. We characterize S-SMART in an experimental dataset with people performing hand actions as part of their usual routines at home and in office buildings. The framework combines dead reckoning from a footworn motion sensor with template-matching-based action recognition, identifying objects in the environment (windows, doors, water taps, phones, etc.) and tracking their state (open/closed, etc.). In real-life recordings with up to 23 action classes, S-SMART consistently outperforms independent systems for positioning and activity recognition, and constructs accurate semantic maps. This environment representation enables novel applications that build upon information about the arrangement and state of the user's surroundings. For example, it may be possible to remind elderly people of a window that they left open before leaving the house, or of a plant they did not water yet, using solely wearable sensors.},

abstract = {The recent indoor localization techniques use inertial sensors for position estimations in order to obtain a certain degree of freedom from infrastructure based solutions. Unfortunately, this dependency cannot be completely eliminated due to the cumulative errors induced in the localization process. While many methods are designed to reduce the required number of reference points or try to offer unsupervised maintenance, completely infrastructure independent solutions are still missing. In this paper we propose a novel approach for mobile-based indoor localization and navigation services by introducing a context-aware localization framework. We exploit the ability to recognize certain human motion patterns with a smartphone, representing activities related to walking, climbing stairs, taking escalators, etc. This allows the detection of corridors, staircases and escalators, knowledge which can be used to create building interior related reference points. Based on these a scenario specific context interpreter controls the localization process and provides position refinement for the elimination of the cumulated errors. Using our solution the auxiliary reference points can be omitted, thus, a completely infrastructure-free localization system is formed. The proposed solution is evaluated in a subway scenario and its performance is analysed focusing on the influence of dead-reckoning error on path reconstruction, the effect of activity detection quality on localization performance, respectively the benefits of using additional context-related information. The results are promising, our solution presents good localization and path reconstruction performance, showing potential for real-world scenarios, where the deployment of auxiliary localization infrastructure is unfeasible.},

abstract = {Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) plays an important role in many (hybrid) indoor positioning systems since it enables frequent, granular position updates. However, the accumulation of errors creates a need for external error correction. In this work, we explore the limits of PDR under realistic conditions using our graph-based system as an example. For this purpose, we collect sensor data while the user performs an actual navigation task using a navigation application on a smartphone. To assess the localisation performance, we introduce a task-oriented metric based on the idea of landmark navigation: instead of specifying the error metrically, we measure the ability to determine the correct segment of an indoor route, which in turn enables the navigation system to give correct instructions. We conduct offline simulations with the collected data in order to identify situations where position tracking fails and explore different options how to mitigate the issues, for example through detection of special features along the user's path or through additional sensors. Our results show that the magnetic compass is often unreliable under realistic conditions and that resetting the position at strategically chosen decision points significantly improves positioning accuracy.},

abstract = {More and more applications of location-based services lead to the development of indoor positioning technology. As a part of the Internet of Things ecosystem, low-power Bluetooth technology provides a new direction for indoor positioning. Most existing indoor positioning algorithms are applied to specific situations. Thus, they are difficult to adapt to actually complex environments and different users. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a precise dead reckoning algorithm based on Bluetooth and multiple sensors (DRBMs). To address positioning accuracy, this paper improves the traditional Bluetooth propagation model and calculate the steps and step lengths for different users in the process of multisensor track calculation. In addition, this paper fuses the localization results of Bluetooth propagation model and multiple sensors through the Kalman filter. The experiment results show that the proposed DRBM algorithm can obtain accurate positions. The localization accuracy is within 1 m, and the best can be controlled within 0.5 m. Compared with the traditional Bluetooth positioning methods and the traditional dead reckoning methods, the proposed algorithm greatly improves positioning accuracy and universality.},

abstract = {Inertial sensors are included in most of the current smart devices and many researchers have identified their ability to be used for analyzing different parameters of human behavior. Among them, the pedestrian's step length provides very useful information for different applications, such as pedestrian dead reckoning positioning or gait analysis. During the last three decades, many step length estimation methods using inertial sensors have been proposed; however, there is no specific review work that reflects the current state of the art. In this paper, we will conduct a systematic and complete review that covers the whole workflow of tasks involved in the design, test, and evaluation of step length estimation methods based on inertial sensors. The main conclusion drawn from this review is that the lack of public data sets and standard methodologies to guide testing and evaluation makes it difficult to compare the different methods in a fair and robust way. Some reflections on how to move forward on this direction have been presented.},

@article{Collins2013a,
abstract = {Human walking exhibits small variations in both step length and step width, some of which may be related to active balance control. Lateral balance is thought to require integrative sensorimotor control through adjustment of step width rather than length, contributing to greater variability in step width. Here we propose that step length variations are largely explained by the typical human preference for step length to increase with walking speed, which itself normally exhibits some slow and spontaneous fluctuation. In contrast, step width variations should have little relation to speed if they are produced more for lateral balance. As a test, we examined hundreds of overground walking steps by healthy young adults (N = 14, age {\textless} 40 yrs.). We found that slow fluctuations in self-selected walking speed (2.3{\%} coefficient of variation) could explain most of the variance in step length (59{\%}, P {\textless} 0.01). The residual variability not explained by speed was small (1.5{\%} coefficient of variation), suggesting that step length is actually quite precise if not for the slow speed fluctuations. Step width varied over faster time scales and was independent of speed fluctuations, with variance 4.3 times greater than that for step length (P {\textless} 0.01) after accounting for the speed effect. That difference was further magnified by walking with eyes closed, which appears detrimental to control of lateral balance. Humans appear to modulate fore-aft foot placement in precise accordance with slow fluctuations in walking speed, whereas the variability of lateral foot placement appears more closely related to balance. Step variability is separable in both direction and time scale into balance- and speed-related components. The separation of factors not related to balance may reveal which aspects of walking are most critical for the nervous system to control. {\textcopyright} 2013 Collins, Kuo.},
