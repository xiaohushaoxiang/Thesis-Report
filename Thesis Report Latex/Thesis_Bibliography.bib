abstract = {This paper presents the large and diverse dataset for development of smartphone-based pedestrian navigation algorithms. This dataset consists of about 1200 sets of inertial measurements from sensors of several smartphones. The measurements are collected while walking through different trajectories up to 10 minutes long. The data are accompanied by the high accuracy ground truth collected with two foot-mounted inertial measurement units and post-processed by the presented algorithms. The dataset suits both for training of intellectual pedestrian navigation algorithms based on learning techniques and for development of pedestrian navigation algorithms based on classical approaches. The dataset is accessible at http://gartseev.ru/projects/ipin2019.},

abstract = {Smartphone pedometry offers the possibility of ubiquitous health monitoring, context awareness and indoor location tracking through Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) systems. However, there is currently no detailed understanding of how well pedometry works when applied to smartphones in typical, unconstrained use. This paper evaluates common walk detection (WD) and step counting (SC) algorithms applied to smartphone sensor data. Using a large dataset (27 people, 130 walks, 6 smartphone placements) optimal algorithm parameters are provided and applied to the data. The results favour the use of standard deviation thresholding (WD) and windowed peak detection (SC) with error rates of less than 3{\%}. Of the six different placements, only the back trouser pocket is found to degrade the step counting performance significantly, resulting in undercounting for many algorithms.},

abstract = {There are an increasing number of smartphone applications using indoor positioning. Ideally, no additional infrastructure is needed and only sensors already present in smartphones are used to compute positions indoors. Therefore, approaches such as pedestrian dead reckoning and human motion monitoring are currently being reviewed. In fact, these approaches are not only being reviewed by research facilities, but are already implemented as application programming interfaces in smartphone operating systems. Step detection, turn detection or magnetic orientation exist as implemented interfaces. However, these interfaces use the raw, uncalibrated smartphone sensor measurements. The presented research analyzes the sensors that can be used for pedestrian dead reckoning, discusses how to calibrate sensor measurements without costly equipment and shows the benefits of using calibrated rather than raw, uncalibrated sensor measurements for pedestrian dead reckoning applications.},

abstract = {Inertial sensors are included in most of the current smart devices and many researchers have identified their ability to be used for analyzing different parameters of human behavior. Among them, the pedestrian's step length provides very useful information for different applications, such as pedestrian dead reckoning positioning or gait analysis. During the last three decades, many step length estimation methods using inertial sensors have been proposed; however, there is no specific review work that reflects the current state of the art. In this paper, we will conduct a systematic and complete review that covers the whole workflow of tasks involved in the design, test, and evaluation of step length estimation methods based on inertial sensors. The main conclusion drawn from this review is that the lack of public data sets and standard methodologies to guide testing and evaluation makes it difficult to compare the different methods in a fair and robust way. Some reflections on how to move forward on this direction have been presented.},

abstract = {In this paper, we present a practical algorithm for calibrating a magnetometer for the presence of magnetic disturbances and for magnetometer sensor errors. To allow for combining the magnetometer measurements with inertial measurements for orientation estimation, the algorithm also corrects for misalignment between the magnetometer and the inertial sensor axes. The calibration algorithm is formulated as the solution to a maximum likelihood problem, and the computations are performed offline. The algorithm is shown to give good results using data from two different commercially available sensor units. Using the calibrated magnetometer measurements in combination with the inertial sensors to determine the sensor's orientation is shown to lead to significantly improved heading estimates.},

This paper looks at how a foot-mounted inertial unit, a detailed building model, and a particle filter can be combined to provide absolute positioning, despite the presence of drift in the inertial unit and without knowledge of the user's initial location. We show how to handle multiple floors and stairways, how to handle symmetry in the environment, and how to initialise the localisation algorithm using WiFi signal strength to reduce initial complexity. We evaluate the entire system experimentally, using an independent tracking system for ground truth. Our results show that we can track a user throughout a 8725 m 2 building spanning three floors to within 0.5m 75{\%} of the time, and to within 0.73 m 95{\%} of the time. Copyright 2008 ACM.},

abstract = {Pedestrian navigation using inertial sensors constitutes an infrastructure-free positioning system. The fact that inertial sensors are already available in every smartphone or other carry on devices constitutes their great advantage and makes them especially interesting for mass market applications. This chapter offers a detailed explanation of the estimation of the orientation of the sensor, since it is of key importance in order to compute the position of the user. The positioning is usually derived in two different ways depending on the location of the sensor on the human body. These two approaches are deeply explained in this chapter. Disregarding the location on the human body where the sensor is mounted on, the accumulated drift error on the estimated positioning is still an unsolved issue using medium- and low-cost inertial sensors. The latest algorithms proposed to tackle the drift error are summarized in this chapter. Finally, an overview of the upcoming pedestrian inertial positioning is offered.},

We explore and optimise further the algorithm and its parameters making use of data collected by three volunteers holding the phone in six different positions. In order to simplify the analysis of the data, we also built a novel device for the detection of the ground truth steps. Over the collected data set, the algorithm reaches 95{\%} average accuracy. We implemented the algorithm for the Android OS and released it as an open source project. A separate dataset was collected with the algorithm running on the smart-phone for further validation. The validation confirms the accuracy of the algorithm in real-time conditions.},

@article{Collins2013a,
abstract = {Human walking exhibits small variations in both step length and step width, some of which may be related to active balance control. Lateral balance is thought to require integrative sensorimotor control through adjustment of step width rather than length, contributing to greater variability in step width. Here we propose that step length variations are largely explained by the typical human preference for step length to increase with walking speed, which itself normally exhibits some slow and spontaneous fluctuation. In contrast, step width variations should have little relation to speed if they are produced more for lateral balance. As a test, we examined hundreds of overground walking steps by healthy young adults (N = 14, age {\textless} 40 yrs.). We found that slow fluctuations in self-selected walking speed (2.3{\%} coefficient of variation) could explain most of the variance in step length (59{\%}, P {\textless} 0.01). The residual variability not explained by speed was small (1.5{\%} coefficient of variation), suggesting that step length is actually quite precise if not for the slow speed fluctuations. Step width varied over faster time scales and was independent of speed fluctuations, with variance 4.3 times greater than that for step length (P {\textless} 0.01) after accounting for the speed effect. That difference was further magnified by walking with eyes closed, which appears detrimental to control of lateral balance. Humans appear to modulate fore-aft foot placement in precise accordance with slow fluctuations in walking speed, whereas the variability of lateral foot placement appears more closely related to balance. Step variability is separable in both direction and time scale into balance- and speed-related components. The separation of factors not related to balance may reveal which aspects of walking are most critical for the nervous system to control. {\textcopyright} 2013 Collins, Kuo.},

Hereby, we have studied the influence of different walking speeds and four typical sensor positions on the models' performance. Results indicate that smartphone position affected the performance of most acceleration-based models derived from a gait model. Their performance deteriorated if smartphone was carried in hand or pocket. Walking speed affected the performance of models that include step frequency when tuned with personalized sets of constants. Most of them performed better for fast and normal walking speeds.

This paper shows that by careful crafting and accounting for the weak information in the sensor samples, smartphones are capable of pure inertial navigation. We present a probabilistic approach for orientation and use-case free inertial odometry, which is based on double-integrating rotated accelerations. The strength of the model is in learning additive and multiplicative IMU biases online. We are able to track the phone position, velocity, and pose in realtime and in a computationally lightweight fashion by solving the inference with an extended Kalman filter. The information fusion is completed with zero-velocity updates (if the phone remains stationary), altitude correction from barometric pressure readings (if available), and pseudo-updates constraining the momentary speed. We demonstrate our approach using an iPad and iPhone in several indoor dead-reckoning applications and in a measurement tool setup.},
