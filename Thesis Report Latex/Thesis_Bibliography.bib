abstract = {Human walking exhibits small variations in both step length and step width, some of which may be related to active balance control. Lateral balance is thought to require integrative sensorimotor control through adjustment of step width rather than length, contributing to greater variability in step width. Here we propose that step length variations are largely explained by the typical human preference for step length to increase with walking speed, which itself normally exhibits some slow and spontaneous fluctuation. In contrast, step width variations should have little relation to speed if they are produced more for lateral balance. As a test, we examined hundreds of overground walking steps by healthy young adults (N = 14, age {\textless} 40 yrs.). We found that slow fluctuations in self-selected walking speed (2.3{\%} coefficient of variation) could explain most of the variance in step length (59{\%}, P {\textless} 0.01). The residual variability not explained by speed was small (1.5{\%} coefficient of variation), suggesting that step length is actually quite precise if not for the slow speed fluctuations. Step width varied over faster time scales and was independent of speed fluctuations, with variance 4.3 times greater than that for step length (P {\textless} 0.01) after accounting for the speed effect. That difference was further magnified by walking with eyes closed, which appears detrimental to control of lateral balance. Humans appear to modulate fore-aft foot placement in precise accordance with slow fluctuations in walking speed, whereas the variability of lateral foot placement appears more closely related to balance. Step variability is separable in both direction and time scale into balance- and speed-related components. The separation of factors not related to balance may reveal which aspects of walking are most critical for the nervous system to control. {\textcopyright} 2013 Collins, Kuo.},

@article{Torok2014,
abstract = {The recent indoor localization techniques use inertial sensors for position estimations in order to obtain a certain degree of freedom from infrastructure based solutions. Unfortunately, this dependency cannot be completely eliminated due to the cumulative errors induced in the localization process. While many methods are designed to reduce the required number of reference points or try to offer unsupervised maintenance, completely infrastructure independent solutions are still missing. In this paper we propose a novel approach for mobile-based indoor localization and navigation services by introducing a context-aware localization framework. We exploit the ability to recognize certain human motion patterns with a smartphone, representing activities related to walking, climbing stairs, taking escalators, etc. This allows the detection of corridors, staircases and escalators, knowledge which can be used to create building interior related reference points. Based on these a scenario specific context interpreter controls the localization process and provides position refinement for the elimination of the cumulated errors. Using our solution the auxiliary reference points can be omitted, thus, a completely infrastructure-free localization system is formed. The proposed solution is evaluated in a subway scenario and its performance is analysed focusing on the influence of dead-reckoning error on path reconstruction, the effect of activity detection quality on localization performance, respectively the benefits of using additional context-related information. The results are promising, our solution presents good localization and path reconstruction performance, showing potential for real-world scenarios, where the deployment of auxiliary localization infrastructure is unfeasible.},

Ideally, no additional infrastructure is needed and only sensors already present in smartphones are used to compute positions indoors. Therefore, approaches such as pedestrian dead reckoning and human motion monitoring are currently being reviewed. In fact, these approaches are not only being reviewed by research facilities, but are already implemented as application programming interfaces in smartphone operating systems. Step detection, turn detection or magnetic orientation exist as implemented interfaces. However, these interfaces use the raw, uncalibrated smartphone sensor measurements. The presented research analyzes the sensors that can be used for pedestrian dead reckoning, discusses how to calibrate sensor measurements without costly equipment and shows the benefits of using calibrated rather than raw, uncalibrated sensor measurements for pedestrian dead reckoning applications.},

abstract = {This paper proposes a novel heading estimation approach for indoor pedestrian navigation using the built-in inertial sensors on a smartphone. Unlike previous approaches constraining the carrying position of a smartphone on the user's body, our approach gives the user a larger freedom by implementing automatic recognition of the device carrying position and subsequent selection of an optimal strategy for heading estimation. We firstly predetermine the motion state by a decision tree using an accelerometer and a barometer. Then, to enable accurate and computational lightweight carrying position recognition, we combine a position classifier with a novel position transition detection algorithm, which may also be used to avoid the confusion between position transition and user turn during pedestrian walking. For a device placed in the trouser pockets or held in a swinging hand, the heading estimation is achieved by deploying a principal component analysis (PCA)-based approach. For a device held in the hand or against the ear during a phone call, user heading is directly estimated by adding the yaw angle of the device to the related heading offset. Experimental results show that our approach can automatically detect carrying positions with high accuracy, and outperforms previous heading estimation approaches in terms of accuracy and applicability.},

This chapter offers a detailed explanation of the estimation of the orientation of the sensor, since it is of key importance in order to compute the position of the user. The positioning is usually derived in two different ways depending on the location of the sensor on the human body. These two approaches are deeply explained in this chapter. Disregarding the location on the human body where the sensor is mounted on, the accumulated drift error on the estimated positioning is still an unsolved issue using medium- and low-cost inertial sensors.

Hereby, we have studied the influence of different walking speeds and four typical sensor positions on the models' performance. Results indicate that smartphone position affected the performance of most acceleration-based models derived from a gait model. Their performance deteriorated if smartphone was carried in hand or pocket. Walking speed affected the performance of models that include step frequency when tuned with personalized sets of constants. Most of them performed better for fast and normal walking speeds.

@article{Hardegger2016,
abstract = {The machine recognition of user trajectories and activities is fundamental to devise context-aware applications for support and monitoring in daily life. So far, tracking and activity recognition were mostly considered as orthogonal problems, which limits the richness of possible context inference. In this work, we introduce the novel unified computational and representational framework S-SMART that simultaneously models the environment state (semantic mapping), localizes the user within this map (tracking), and recognizes interactions with the environment (activity recognition). Thus, S-SMART identifies which activities the user executes where (e.g., turning a handle next to a window), and reflects the outcome of these actions by updating the world model (e.g., the window is now open). This in turn conditions the future possibility of executing actions at specific places (e.g., closing the window is likely to be the next action at this location). S-SMART works in a self-contained manner and iteratively builds the semantic map from wearable sensors only. This enables the seamless deployment to new environments. We characterize S-SMART in an experimental dataset with people performing hand actions as part of their usual routines at home and in office buildings. The framework combines dead reckoning from a footworn motion sensor with template-matching-based action recognition, identifying objects in the environment (windows, doors, water taps, phones, etc.) and tracking their state (open/closed, etc.). In real-life recordings with up to 23 action classes, S-SMART consistently outperforms independent systems for positioning and activity recognition, and constructs accurate semantic maps. This environment representation enables novel applications that build upon information about the arrangement and state of the user's surroundings. For example, it may be possible to remind elderly people of a window that they left open before leaving the house, or of a plant they did not water yet, using solely wearable sensors.},

In this paper, we propose a PDR system to track a pedestrian holding a smartphone while he/she walks in a building. To eliminate the inevitable accumulated error over time, we suggest a method of using location related information from environments. We named it ‘landmark', which is defined as a specific area (or point) where the pedestrian passes by in a building such as a stair, a door, a corner or a crossroad. If the system detects a landmark during the walking period, then it will correct the position of the user with the pre-defined position information of the landmark. In this work, we propose one kind of landmark called the door landmark. We have developed a method to detect the landmarks only using the sensors embedded in smartphones. The door landmark can be detected by combining the features from the magnetic sensor and user's walking behavior. Via a set of experiments, we have evaluated the performances of the landmark detection and the position tracking of the system.},

For this purpose, we collect sensor data while the user performs an actual navigation task using a navigation application on a smartphone. To assess the localisation performance, we introduce a task-oriented metric based on the idea of landmark navigation: instead of specifying the error metrically, we measure the ability to determine the correct segment of an indoor route, which in turn enables the navigation system to give correct instructions. We conduct offline simulations with the collected data in order to identify situations where position tracking fails and explore different options how to mitigate the issues, for example through detection of special features along the user's path or through additional sensors. Our results show that the magnetic compass is often unreliable under realistic conditions and that resetting the position at strategically chosen decision points significantly improves positioning accuracy.},

abstract = {We consider the human localization problem using body-worn inertial/magnetic sensor units. Inertial sensors are characterized by a drift error caused by the integration of their rate output to obtain position information. Because of this drift, the position and orientation data obtained from inertial sensors are reliable over only short periods of time. Therefore, position updates from externally referenced sensors are essential. However, if the map of the environment is known, the activity context of the user can provide information about his position. In particular, the switches in the activity context correspond to discrete locations on the map. By performing localization simultaneously with activity recognition, we detect the activity context switches and use the corresponding position information as position updates in a localization filter. The localization filter also involves a smoother that combines the two estimates obtained by running the zero-velocity update algorithm both forward and backward in time. We performed experiments with eight subjects in indoor and outdoor environments involving walking, turning and standing activities. Using a spatial error criterion, we show that the position errors can be decreased by about 85{\%} on the average. We also present the results of two 3D experiments performed in realistic indoor environments and demonstrate that it is possible to achieve over 90{\%} error reduction in position by performing localization simultaneously with activity recognition. {\textcopyright} 2012 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {The position of on-body motion sensors plays an important role in human activity recognition. Most often, mobile phone sensors at the trouser pocket or an equivalent position are used for this purpose. However, this position is not suitable for recognizing activities that involve hand gestures, such as smoking, eating, drinking coffee and giving a talk. To recognize such activities, wrist-worn motion sensors are used. However, these two positions are mainly used in isolation. To use richer context information, we evaluate three motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and linear acceleration sensor) at both wrist and pocket positions. Using three classifiers, we show that the combination of these two positions outperforms the wrist position alone, mainly at smaller segmentation windows. Another problem is that less-repetitive activities, such as smoking, eating, giving a talk and drinking coffee, cannot be recognized easily at smaller segmentation windows unlike repetitive activities, like walking, jogging and biking. For this purpose, we evaluate the effect of seven window sizes (2–30 s) on thirteen activities and show how increasing window size affects these various activities in different ways. We also propose various optimizations to further improve the recognition of these activities. For reproducibility, we make our dataset publicly available.},

Decision trees have become one of the most powerful and popular approaches in knowledge discovery and data mining, the science and technology of exploring large and complex bodies of data in order to discover useful patterns. The area is of great importance because it enables modeling and knowledge extraction from the abundance of data available. Both theoreticians and practitioners are continually seeking techniques to make the process more efficient, cost-effective and accurate. Decision trees, originally implemented in decision theory and statistics, are highly effective tools in other areas such as data mining, text mining, information extraction, machine learning, and pattern recognition.This book invites readers to explore the many benefits in data mining that decision trees offer: self-explanatory and easy to follow when compacted; able to handle a variety of input data: nominal, numeric and textual; able to process datasets that may have errors or missing values; high predictive performance for a relatively small computational effort; available in many data mining packages over a variety of platforms; and, useful for various tasks, such as classification, regression, clustering and feature selection.},

abstract = {A flexible, low cost, and portable indoor navigational aid for persons who are blind or have severe visual impairments remains an unmet need and a technical challenge. Whereas devices using global positioning system (GPS) signals hold promise for navigational assistance in the outdoor environment, they do not work where GPS signals are absent or greatly attenuated. Thus a network of navigational beacons is needed for the indoor environment. This paper describes the promise of an indoor navigational aid that relies on a network of custom extended-range RFID tags. RFID (radio-frequency identification) technology has the advantages of being low cost, unobtrusive, and highly flexible in the sense that sight impaired travelers can use personalized RFID tags to mark indoor locations of their particular interest. However, commercially available RFID tags have very short detection ranges. To make them suitable as indoor electronic beacons, their range of detection must be greatly extended. Some of the technical challenges and proposed solutions that can extend the detection range are discussed in this paper following an overview of the proposed RFID based indoor navigational aid.},

abstract = {Indoor pedestrian tracking extends location-based services to indoor environments where GPS signal is rarely detected. Typical indoor localization method is Wi-Fi-based positioning system, which is practical showing accuracy and extending coverage. However, it involves significant costs of installing and managing wireless access points. A practical indoor pedestrian-tracking approach should consider the absence of any infrastructure or pretrained database. In this paper, we present a smartphone-based pedestrian dead reckoning, SmartPDR, which tracks pedestrians through typical dead reckoning approach using data from inertial sensors embedded in smartphones. SmartPDR does not require any complex and expensive additional device or infrastructure that most existing pedestrian tracking systems rely on. The proposed system was implemented on off-the-shelf smartphones and the performance was evaluated in several buildings. Despite inherent localization errors from low-cost noisy sensors and complicated human movements, SmartPDR successfully tracks indoor user's location, which is confirmed from the experimental results with reasonable location accuracy. Indoor pedestrian tracking system using smartphone inertial sensors can be a promising methodology validating its practical usage through real deployment.},

We present a probabilistic approach for orientation and use-case free inertial odometry, which is based on double-integrating rotated accelerations. The strength of the model is in learning additive and multiplicative IMU biases online. We are able to track the phone position, velocity, and pose in realtime and in a computationally lightweight fashion by solving the inference with an extended Kalman filter. The information fusion is completed with zero-velocity updates (if the phone remains stationary), altitude correction from barometric pressure readings (if available), and pseudo-updates constraining the momentary speed.

abstract = {Pedestrian dead reckoning (PDR) is a potential technique for smartphone-based indoor localization using the built-in accelerometers and gyroscopes. However, most current PDR positioning approaches restrict the pose to carry a phone, such as holding it in front of the body during tracking. In addition, heading determination is the primary error sources in PDR systems, and hence, a magnetometer is normally required to reduce heading errors. However, in indoor environments, magnetometer outputs would be seriously distorted by magnetic disturbances from the building structures and electronics. In this paper, an experimental heuristic approach to multi-pose PDR (mpPDR) indoor positioning for structured environments has been proposed. Six poses and four modes to carry a phone could be recognized, and then, on the basis of different modes, an experimental approach to the heading determination without using magnetometers has been presented to reduce the heading error considering the effects of turning and hand-shaking events. The experimental results indicate that the proposed approach supports four smartphone modes with a high position accuracy of 97.99{\%}.},

To address the challenges of flexible and complex contexts of carrying a phone while walking, a robust step detection algorithm based on motion-awareness has been proposed. Given the fact that step length is influenced by different motion states, an adaptive step length estimation algorithm based on motion recognition is developed. Heading estimation is carried out by an attitude acquisition algorithm, which contains a two-phase filter to mitigate the distortion of magnetic anomalies. In order to estimate the heading for an unconstrained smartphone, principal component analysis (PCA) of acceleration is applied to determine the offset between the orientation of smartphone and the actual heading of a pedestrian. Moreover, a particle filter with vector graph assisted particle weighting is introduced to correct the deviation in step length and heading estimation. Extensive field tests, including four contexts of carrying a phone, have been conducted in an office building to verify the performance of the proposed algorithm. Test results show that the proposed algorithm can achieve sub-meter mean error in all contexts.},

abstract = {PDR (Pedestrian Dead Reckoning) is a relative positioning method using step length and heading. However, the step length is varying while a pedestrian performs different motions. With estimated motion state, the adaptive step length model can be applied. Considering that human motion is a continuous procedure, in this paper, we propose a sequence-based motion recognition method which estimates the motion states from a sequence of data. In contrast with traditional classifiers, this paper deploys a HMM (Hidden Markov Model) to infer the state labels of sequence motion. And with the assist of motion recognition, a 3D indoor pedestrian localization is presented. Experimental results show that the classification accuracy of sequence-based motion recognition is improved comparing to that of using Na{\"{i}}ve Bayes classifier on standalone motion states. Furthermore, the positioning accuracy of a pedestrian in indoor environments is promoted using proposed method in this paper. The mean positioning error is reduced from 0.78 to 0.30 m.

It draws explicit connections to branches such as spline smoothing models and support vector machines in which similar ideas have been investigated. Gaussian process models are routinely used to solve hard machine learning problems. They are attractive because of their flexible non-parametric nature and computational simplicity. Treated within a Bayesian framework, very powerful statistical methods can be implemented which offer valid estimates of uncertainties in our predictions and generic model selection procedures cast as nonlinear optimization problems. Their main drawback of heavy computational scaling has recently been alleviated by the introduction of generic sparse approximations.13,78,31 The mathematical literature on GPs is large and often uses deep concepts which are not required to fully understand most machine learning applications.

abstract = {The position of on-body motion sensors plays an important role in human activity recognition. Most often, mobile phone sensors at the trouser pocket or an equivalent position are used for this purpose. However, this position is not suitable for recognizing activities that involve hand gestures, such as smoking, eating, drinking coffee and giving a talk. To recognize such activities, wrist-worn motion sensors are used. However, these two positions are mainly used in isolation. To use richer context information, we evaluate three motion sensors (accelerometer, gyroscope and linear acceleration sensor) at both wrist and pocket positions. Using three classifiers, we show that the combination of these two positions outperforms the wrist position alone, mainly at smaller segmentation windows. Another problem is that less-repetitive activities, such as smoking, eating, giving a talk and drinking coffee, cannot be recognized easily at smaller segmentation windows unlike repetitive activities, like walking, jogging and biking. For this purpose, we evaluate the effect of seven window sizes (2–30 s) on thirteen activities and show how increasing window size affects these various activities in different ways. We also propose various optimizations to further improve the recognition of these activities. For reproducibility, we make our dataset publicly available.},

abstract = {While indoor portable navigation using portable devices is becoming increasingly required, it faces many challenges in obtaining accurate positioning performance. One of the methods to improve navigation results is to recognize the mode of motion of the user carrying the portable device containing low-cost microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) motion sensors. Pattern recognition methodology has been employed to detect a group of motion modes that are common indoors, namely, walking, stationary, going up/down stairs, standing on an escalator, walking on an escalator, standing on a moving walkway, and walking on a moving walkway. The performance of the motion mode recognition module was examined on different types of mobile computing devices, including various brands of smartphones, tablets, smartwatches, and smartglasses, and the results obtained showed the capability of enhancing positioning performance. The module does not require satellite or wireless positioning signals, and depends only on MEMS sensors.},

abstract = {More and more applications of location-based services lead to the development of indoor positioning technology. As a part of the Internet of Things ecosystem, low-power Bluetooth technology provides a new direction for indoor positioning. Most existing indoor positioning algorithms are applied to specific situations. Thus, they are difficult to adapt to actually complex environments and different users. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a precise dead reckoning algorithm based on Bluetooth and multiple sensors (DRBMs). To address positioning accuracy, this paper improves the traditional Bluetooth propagation model and calculate the steps and step lengths for different users in the process of multisensor track calculation. In addition, this paper fuses the localization results of Bluetooth propagation model and multiple sensors through the Kalman filter. The experiment results show that the proposed DRBM algorithm can obtain accurate positions. The localization accuracy is within 1 m, and the best can be controlled within 0.5 m. Compared with the traditional Bluetooth positioning methods and the traditional dead reckoning methods, the proposed algorithm greatly improves positioning accuracy and universality.},

@article{Diez2018b,
abstract = {Inertial sensors are included in most of the current smart devices and many researchers have identified their ability to be used for analyzing different parameters of human behavior. Among them, the pedestrian's step length provides very useful information for different applications, such as pedestrian dead reckoning positioning or gait analysis. During the last three decades, many step length estimation methods using inertial sensors have been proposed; however, there is no specific review work that reflects the current state of the art. In this paper, we will conduct a systematic and complete review that covers the whole workflow of tasks involved in the design, test, and evaluation of step length estimation methods based on inertial sensors. The main conclusion drawn from this review is that the lack of public data sets and standard methodologies to guide testing and evaluation makes it difficult to compare the different methods in a fair and robust way. Some reflections on how to move forward on this direction have been presented.},
