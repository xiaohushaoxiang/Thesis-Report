\section{Discussion}
Within the discussion the results of the different \ac{SHS} components and the overall system will be treated, postulating what may have lead to certain outcomes with supporting evidence. Different future avenues are outlined to gain further insight.

\subsection*{Step Detection}
For step detection, the implementation of \cref{algo:step_detect} was compared with that of \citet{Salvi2018}, who had continued the work of \cite{Harle2013}.  \par

\subsection*{Orientation Estimation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item There is no concrete way with the data available to check how well the EKF estimate is working in comparison to reality. Only comparing to the android system is possible.
	\item trial 3 and trial 6 had the largest yaw difference of the trials. The yaw traces between the android system and EKF can be found in \cref{fig:202011181708yawdifferencebetweenmethods} and \cref{fig:202011181705yawdifferencebetweenmethods}
	\item EKF for trial 6 has a weird jump and slowly gets back to the estimate of the android system. Not clear what is causing this. \textcolor{red}{How should I handle this further?}
	\item for trial 3 there seems to be a slight offset between the orientation estimations, but the change in angle looks similar.
	\item Further testing will be needed to determine if the effect of magnet disturbances has caused wrong yaw orientation estimation. Using a more accurate device, such as a xsens\ac{IMU}could be a good comparison.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Overall System Performance}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Using door interactions that were manually indicated, 4 out of 6 trials were able to complete all iterations. They do have a difference in median RMSE value and the spread between iterations. The reasoning why this is occurring can be spotted in the trajectories that the Particle Filter calculates.  
	\item 
	
	\item Comparing the results when activity recognition is not used, the use of activity recognition can potentially improve localization since more trials are able to survive the whole \ac{SHS}trajectory when it is than when it is not. Furthermore, the trajectories have low RMSE values compared to the video analysis trajectory, suggesting correct estimation. This is most apparent with trial 7, wherewith activity recognition it is able to complete the whole route every time, while without it only one iteration survives with a large error with the video estimate. The results also show that it is not a necessity in some cases to use this form of measurement update, as trial 1 and 2 completing all iterations with similar RMSE values regardless of whether AR is used or not.
	\item When using the AR method outlined in \cref{chap:method}, trial 3 was unable to complete all iterations. The iterations that were completed had a large range of RMSE. This is likely caused by false positives "pulling" the particles in the wrong direction. Plots still need to be made to show this.

\section{Answering Research Questions}

\textcolor{cyan}{this will depend on the the eventual research questions that are found}

\section{Future Work}

{\color{purple}
\textbf{Step detection}
\begin{itemize}
	\item using data from \cite{Salvi2018} determine if parameters found are also the best parameters for the implementation used in this thesis.
	\item Step detection is a form of activity recognition, investigate if other machine learning techniques can perform better  
	\item testing was performed walking on a hard floor and it will be necessary to investigate softer surfaces like carpet or grass.
	\item Determine robustness against more complex movements
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step length estimation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item generate more first hand data, maybe in a motion capture lab  
	\item use \cite{Bayev2019}, a data set that has recently been made to develop smartphone based pedestrian navigation 
	\item make the assumption that step length is constant and determine effect on performance
	\item when making a turn both feet do not travel the same distance. The inside foot will make a smaller step, while the outer a large one. Determine how turning affects the step length estimation.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Orientation estimation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item use the method of \cite{Michel2018} to handle magnetic field disturbances
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Step heading estimation}
\begin{itemize}
	\item The testing was limited to one carrying mode, so that the yaw of the device would represent the direction in which the test subject is moving. Step heading estimation will need to be applied in order for the phone to be in other carrying modes.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Particle filter}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Test without furniture or with a different probability density for furniture
	\item decrease probability close to walls since people do not generally walk close to walls
	\item different representation of map, instead of grid based more node and edge approach. 
	\item be able to detect when moving to a different floor
	\item combine other drift reduction methods
	\item initialize particles over whole map instead of defining a starting point.
	\item find a way to use less particles in order to be implementable on portable device. Above solutions could already help with this.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Activity Recognition}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Detect more useful activities that can be used as additional Particle Filter measurement update. For example, climbing stairs for only smartphone sensors, or more intricate activities such as cooking
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Testing}
\begin{itemize}
	\item different building testing. The current contained may different ways of walking around, while other buildings with more corridor structures are more restrictive. Potentially the SHS-PF technique could have better performance in these settings.
	\item better ground truth determination for both positioning and orientation. ORB-SLAM2 was tried but could not get it to work with footage from phone.
	\item online calculation of position on device
	\item test with different people to determine how user sensitive this is.
\end{itemize}}
