abstract = {Inertial sensors are included in most of the current smart devices and many researchers have identified their ability to be used for analyzing different parameters of human behavior. Among them, the pedestrian's step length provides very useful information for different applications, such as pedestrian dead reckoning positioning or gait analysis. During the last three decades, many step length estimation methods using inertial sensors have been proposed; however, there is no specific review work that reflects the current state of the art. In this paper, we will conduct a systematic and complete review that covers the whole workflow of tasks involved in the design, test, and evaluation of step length estimation methods based on inertial sensors. The main conclusion drawn from this review is that the lack of public data sets and standard methodologies to guide testing and evaluation makes it difficult to compare the different methods in a fair and robust way. Some reflections on how to move forward on this direction have been presented.},

abstract = {Step counting from smart-phones allows a wide range of applications related to fitness and health. Estimating steps from phones' accelerometers is challenging because of the multitude of ways a smart-phone can be carried. We focus our work on the windowed peak detection algorithm, which has previously been shown to be accurate and efficient and thus suitable for mobile devices. We explore and optimise further the algorithm and its parameters making use of data collected by three volunteers holding the phone in six different positions. In order to simplify the analysis of the data, we also built a novel device for the detection of the ground truth steps. Over the collected data set, the algorithm reaches 95{\%} average accuracy. We implemented the algorithm for the Android OS and released it as an open source project. A separate dataset was collected with the algorithm running on the smart-phone for further validation. The validation confirms the accuracy of the algorithm in real-time conditions.},

abstract = {Smartphone pedometry offers the possibility of ubiquitous health monitoring, context awareness and indoor location tracking through Pedestrian Dead Reckoning (PDR) systems. However, there is currently no detailed understanding of how well pedometry works when applied to smartphones in typical, unconstrained use. This paper evaluates common walk detection (WD) and step counting (SC) algorithms applied to smartphone sensor data. Using a large dataset (27 people, 130 walks, 6 smartphone placements) optimal algorithm parameters are provided and applied to the data. The results favour the use of standard deviation thresholding (WD) and windowed peak detection (SC) with error rates of less than 3{\%}. Of the six different placements, only the back trouser pocket is found to degrade the step counting performance significantly, resulting in undercounting for many algorithms.},
