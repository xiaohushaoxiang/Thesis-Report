	[] general introduction

Results

PF:
[] get a bar chart of the performance of the different particle filter trials
[] show that MAP and RMSE are not good enough estimates for the PF

Discussion
[]

Future Work
[x] make bullet points on what can be changed

General

Run all of it through grammarly

THINGS TO DO TODAY:

with trial 1 determine if more particles improve estimates

do all trails without the AR

for first three trials get better rmse by using more particles

outline why for trial 5 this is not working

write research questions

bullet point the discussion
